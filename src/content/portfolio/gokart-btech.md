## Project Details
As a Design Head, I have designed the roll cage and the placement of various subsystems like engine, braking, etc considering the safety and comfort of the driver, using Solidworks. Usually, a guideline handbook will be provided by the organizers and we need to optimize the design parameters for better safety and performance. I carried out static structural analysis of the roll cage under maximum loads that can be experienced by the vehicle at it's maximum speed if an accident occurs. Apart from designing, I was involved in carrying out profile cutting and welding to assemble the roll cage.
