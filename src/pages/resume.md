# Experience

## **CFD Engineer | Hydro Pneumatic Engineers Pvt Ltd | Hyderabad, India | Aug 2020 \- Nov 2020**

Contributed to the development of an in-house Scramjet engine by working on the optimization of the intake to minimize spillage.  Significantly improved nozzle design by employing the Method of Characteristics, resulting in a 10% increase in thrust and a 3% reduction in length. Additionally, conducted design simulations for the scramjet combustor, focusing on the complexities of high-speed reacting flows. All simulations were performed using ICEM-CFD and ANSYS Fluent software.

## **Executive Trainer | Talentio Solutions India | Hyderabad, India | Jan 2020 \- Mar 2020**

Developed and delivered a comprehensive training program for mechanical engineering undergraduates, focusing on the practical application of Python programming language in solving numerical problems. The course content included instruction on core Python syntax, numerical algorithms, and data analysis techniques, with a strong emphasis on hands-on exercises and real-world engineering applications.

# Academic Projects

## **Development and Optimization of Cavitation Models for Cloud Cavitation | Virginia Tech**

Performed extensive numerical studies that resulted in reducing numerical uncertainty by 8%. Determined that domain decomposition and preconditioners significantly influence **multiphase flow dynamics**. Identified distinct cavity shedding mechanisms through experimental investigations. Applied **RAFT optical flow algorithm** on high-speed images to estimate velocities of vapor structures. Observed key differences in the fluid flow between experiments and simulation data from different computational models. Developing new parameters for cavitation models based on experimental insights, to improve model accuracy for **two phase** cavitating flows.

## **Implementing Verification and Validation Framework on an OpenFOAM solver | Virginia Tech**

Verified and validated an **OpenFOAM** solver for 2D steady-state incompressible laminar flow using Roy-Oberkampf framework. Estimated the **predictive uncertainty** of the solver by considering aleatory and epistemic inputs separately. Quantified the numerical uncertainty using Richardson extrapolation and Roache's Grid Convergence Index (GCI). Achieved a model form uncertainty (d) of 0.8472 using the Area Validation Metric. Demonstrated the importance of considering all sources of uncertainty for making risk-informed decisions.

## **Optimization of Heat Sink for Cooling a Chip | Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham**

Optimized **heat sink** for a chip with 100W/cm^2 by varying base thickness, fin height, fin thickness, number of fins and proximity of fan using Ansys Icepak. Obtained 15% drop in Tmax compared to base heat sink. Observed that the thermal spread resistance is on the higher side with a heat sink alone and implemented **vapor chamber** and **heat pipes**. Achieved about 40% drop in Tmax using a vapor chamber as heat spreader.

## **Numerical investigation of Scramjet combustor | Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham**

Developed a **quasi-one-dimensional model** to predict scramjet combustor performance with high computational efficiency and predicted wall pressure distribution with reasonable accuracy (maximum error of 8.04%). Conducted three-dimensional simulations using **ANSYS CFX** to optimize scramjet combustor performance. Optimized injection angle and injector diameter for maximum thrust, combustion efficiency, and minimum total pressure loss using **Kriging method and Non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm**. Achieved optimum results with injector diameter of 1 mm, injection angle of 90 degrees, thrust of 227.364 N, combustion efficiency of 92.56871%, and total pressure loss of 45.1%.
